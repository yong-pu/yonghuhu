# 掩护 (Screen)

在NBA官方网站的[Rulebook](https://official.nba.com/rulebook/)中，共有五处涉及掩护。

### [RULE NO. 4: Definitions](https://official.nba.com/rule-no-4-definitions/#screen)

> Section IX—Screen
>
> A screen is the legal action of a player who, without causing undue contact, delays or prevents an opponent from reaching a desired position.

　　当掩护人没有过度接触、延误或阻挡防守人到达预期位置时，掩护是合法行为。

### [RULE NO. 6: Putting Ball in Play - Live/Dead Ball](https://official.nba.com/rule-no-6-putting-ball-in-play-live-dead-ball/)

> On the following infractions, the ball shall be awarded to the opposing team on the sideline at the nearest spot but no nearer to the baseline than the free throw line extended:
> 1. Traveling

> 3. Striking or kicking the ball on any situation except a throw-in
> 4. Swinging of elbows
> 5. Shot clock violation
> 6. Offensive screen set out-of-bounds
> 7. Offensive player illegally out-of-bounds

　　在下列违例中，应在边线最近处、不超过罚球线延长线（距离底线不能比罚球线延长线更近）的位置，将球交给对方球队：
1. 走步
2. 运球违例
3. 除掷球入界外、任何情况下的击球或脚踢球
4. 挥肘
5. 24秒违例
6. 界外设置进攻掩护
7. 进攻球员非法离开比赛区域

### [RULE NO. 10: Violations and Penalties](https://official.nba.com/rule-no-10-violations-and-penalties/)

> Section XIV—Offensive Screen Set Out-of-Bounds
>
> An offensive player shall not leave the playing area of the floor on the endline in the frontcourt for the purpose of setting a screen.
>
> 1. PENALTY: Loss of ball. The ball is awarded to the opposing team on the sideline at the point of interruption but no nearer to the baseline than the foul line extended.

　　进攻球员不得在前场底线离开比赛区域设置掩护。

### [RULE NO. 12: Fouls and Penalties](https://official.nba.com/rule-no-12-fouls-and-penalties/#byscreening)

> Section III—By Screening
>
> A player who sets a screen shall not (1) assume a position nearer than a normal step from an opponent, if that opponent is stationary and unaware of the screener’s position, or (2) make illegal contact with an opponent when he assumes a position at the side or front of an opponent, or (3) assume a position so near to a moving opponent that he is not given an opportunity to avoid contact before making illegal contact, or (4) move laterally or toward an opponent being screened, after having assumed a legal position. The screener may move in the same direction and path of the opponent being screened.
>
> In (3) above, the speed of the opponent being screened will determine what the screener’s stationary position may be. This position will vary and may be one to two normal steps or strides from his opponent.

1. 如果被阻延的对方球员没有移动且不知道掩护人的位置，掩护人不得于其一步距离之内设置掩护；
2. 掩护人不得与被阻延的对方球员有正面或侧面的非法接触；
3. 如果被阻延的对方球员处于移动中，掩护人必须为其预留避免接触的空间：被阻延的对方球员的移动速度决定了掩护人可以设置掩护的位置，该位置不确定，大约与被阻延的对方球员有一到两步的距离。
4. 掩护人取得合法位置后，不得横向或朝向被阻延的对方球员移动，但可以与被阻延的对方球员以相同方向移动。

### [Comments on the Rules](https://official.nba.com/comments-on-the-rules/#contact)

> 3\. Screening
>
> When a player screens in front of or at the side of a stationary opponent, he may be as close as he desires providing he does not make contact. His opponent can see him and, there- fore, is expected to detour around the screen.
>
> If he screens behind a stationary opponent, the opponent must be able to take a normal step backward without contact. Because the opponent is not expected to see a screener behind him, the player screened is given latitude of movement. The defender must be given an opportunity to change direction and avoid contact with the screener.
>
> To screen a moving opponent, the player must stop soon enough to permit his opponent the opportunity to avoid contact. The distance between the player screening and his opponent will depend upon the speed at which the players are moving.
>
> If two opponents are moving in the same direction and path, the player who is behind is responsible for contact. The player in front may stop or slow his pace, but he may not move backward or sideward into his opponent. The player in front may or may not have the ball. This situation assumes the two players have been moving in identically the same direction and path before contact.

　　当掩护人在对方静止球员的正面或侧面设置掩护时，可以在不发生接触的情况下尽可能地靠近对方球员。对方球员能看到掩护人，所以应该可以绕过掩护。

　　如果掩护在对方静止球员地后方设置掩护，对方球员必须能退后一步而不发生接触。因为对方球员看不到身后的掩护人，所以需要移动的余地。防守人必须有变向或避免与掩护人接触的空间。

　　要阻延运动中的对方球员，掩护人必须尽快停下以给对方球员预留避免接触的空间。掩护人与对方球员之间的距离取决于两位球员移动的速度。

　　如果双方球员以相同的方向和路线移动，位于后方的球员需要为接触负责。前方的球员可以停下或放慢脚步，但不可以向后或侧向移动而接触到后方球员。前方的球员可以持球或无球。这种情况假定两个球员在接触之前一直以相同的方向和路线移动。

## 结论

　　综上所述，规则并不禁止移动。被禁止的是**横向或朝向被阻延的对方球员**的移动，而**与被阻延的对方球员以相同方向移动**是规则所认可的掩护时的移动。因此，所谓“移动掩护”本质上是个错误的说法。
